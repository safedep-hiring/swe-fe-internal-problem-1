# Insights all Along!

Any modern software written today depends on code from open source ecosystems.
In fact, Linux Foundation has estimated that 70-90% of the code in any modern
software is from open sources in form of libraries, frameworks, and tools. Have
you ever wondered whats inside these libraries?

## Problem

Design and build a single page frontend using SafeDep [Insights
API](https://docs.safedep.io/guides/insights-api-using-typescript). The
deliverables should consist of:

1. Figma design of visualizing insights data for an OSS package
2. Implementation of the design using React and Tailwind CSS (feel free to use
   React based frameworks and libraries)

For your reference:

- See [insights-client](./insights-client), a Typescript example of how to use Insights API
- See [sample.json](./sample.json) for an example response from Insights API, useful for mocking

### Instructions

1. Create a public Figma design of the visualization of insights data for an OSS package
2. Create a public GitHub repository with your frontend implementation (code)
3. Share the Figma design link and GitHub repository link with `jobs@safedep.io` to setup interview
