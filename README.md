# Insights all Along!

Any modern software written today depends on code from open source ecosystems.
In fact, Linux Foundation has estimated that 70-90% of the code in any modern
software is from open sources in form of libraries, frameworks, and tools. Have
you ever wondered whats inside these libraries?

## Problem

Build a frontend application using SafeDep [Insights
API](https://docs.safedep.io/guides/insights-api-using-typescript). The
deliverables should consist of:

1. Wireframe design of the visualization of insights data for an OSS package
2. Implementation of the design using React and Tailwind CSS (feel free to use
   React based frameworks (e.g. `nextjs`) and libraries)

Consider using [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) instead of building components
from scratch.

For your reference:

- See [insights-client](./insights-client), a Typescript example of how to use Insights API
- See [sample.json](./sample.json) for an example response from Insights API, useful for mocking

### Instructions

1. Create a public GitHub repository
2. Create an issue in your GitHub repository with the title `Design Wireframe`
3. Add the code implementing your solution to the repository
4. Share the repository URL with `jobs@safedep.io` in any pre-existing email thread
